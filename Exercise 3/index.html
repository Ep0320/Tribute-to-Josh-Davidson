    <section><h2>Biography</h2></section>
    <p>Joshua Bryan Davidson was born on March 26th, 2005. For most of his life he has lived in Tolono, IL. He lives with his mom, dad, little brother Jake who is a high school senior, his little sister Lizzie who is in middle school, and his two geckos. He became a boyscout when he was in first grade at the age of 7 or 8 and became an Eagle Scout at age 17. He finished scouts at the age of 18. His whole family loves watching and playing hockey so he played hockey for almost 10 years. He started at the age of 8 but he stopped playing contact hockey at the age of 17 after two concussions. Once in a while he'll still play noncontact hockey for fun and he still enjoys ice skating. He went to Unity High School and graduated in 2023.  Some of his best friends include Luke, Daniel, Hunter, Emily, and Ashley, some of which he went to highschool with. After graduating highschool he started his first job at the Savoy 16 IMAX movie theater in Savoy, IL. He has made friends with almost everyone at the theater but his favorite coworkers are no doubt Michael, Aidan, Caedmon, Rock, Dallas, Eva, as well as Hunter and Daniel who were mentioned previously. He started dating one of his coworkers, Eva after a few months of starting the job. They have been dating for over a year now and she always says that she is always so grateful to have him in her life. When Josh is older he hopes to become a personal trainer, a zamboni driver, to work on a pitcrew for races, or to be a professional racecar driver.</p>
